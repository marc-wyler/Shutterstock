Metadata Editor (PowerShell)
This repository contains PowerShell scripts designed to streamline photo organization by enabling bulk renaming and metadata editing.
Features

✅ Bulk Rename Photos – Rename multiple images based on a user-defined format.

Shutterstock-Metadata.ps1 (executed with Start-MetadataEditor.vbs)
✅ Edit Metadata – Modify image properties such as keywords, description, name, and date/time. -> Currently not possible, Metadata will be only added to the Excel.
✅ Excel Event Logging – Automatically logs actions in an .xlsx file for tracking changes.
