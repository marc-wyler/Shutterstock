📷 Metadata Editor (PowerShell)

A set of PowerShell scripts designed to simplify photo organization by enabling bulk renaming and metadata editing. Ideal for photographers, archivists, and anyone managing large collections of images.

✨ Features

🔄 Bulk Rename Images (Bulk-Rename-Images.ps1)

    Rename multiple images based on a user-defined format.

📝 Metadata Editing (Shutterstock-Metadata.ps1, executed via Start-MetadataEditor.vbs)

    Metadata Management: Modify image properties such as keywords, descriptions, names, and timestamps. (Note: Currently, metadata is only added to the Excel file.)
    Excel Event Logging: Automatically logs all changes in an .xlsx file for easy tracking.
    Keyword Suggestions: When entering a title that already exists, previously used keywords are displayed for reference.

📌 More scripts and features may be added in future updates!
